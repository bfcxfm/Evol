# Evol, the Hunger Game

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Welcome to "Evol, The Hunger Game" where the ultimate objective is to consume enough particles to grow larger than any other on the level! Get ready to embark on an exciting adventure through each level as you aim to dominate and establish your supremacy. Keep in mind that success hinges on both consuming and evading the larger entities to secure the top position.ÃŸ

You can experience the [Demo](https://works.creaturexd.com/evol/) here!


<h2>Game Setup</h2>

In this game, you will take control of the black bubble as the player and navigate it through a colorful playground filled with bubbles of various sizes.

Your mission is to become the largest bubble in the playground by consuming smaller bubbles and growing in size.

Be cautious though! If your bubble accidentally touches a bubble larger than itself, your size will start to shrink. To emerge victorious, swiftly maneuver away from larger bubbles to avoid diminishing in size. Remember, the player will only triumph if they remain larger than any other bubble in the playground.

<h3>Adaptive Design</h3>

Get ready to experience the game on a variety of devices with an adaptive design feature. Whether you're playing on a desktop (with a screen width larger than 768px), an iPad, or a mobile device, this game is designed with tailored controls for each platform.

<p align="center">

</p>

On desktop, enjoy seamless gameplay with keyboard and mouse control support, allowing you to navigate your bubble player with precision and ease. For iPad and mobile users, immerse yourself in the game with touch screen control support, making it intuitive and convenient to maneuver your bubble through the playground.

<h3>Favourites and Challenges</h3>

A primary feature of the game involves the algorithmic generation of bubbles without overlapping, coupled with the implementation of animations triggered by bubble interactions - a favored aspect of the game.

        y = Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.height - 2 * radius)) + radius;
    } while (bubbles.some(bubble => Bubble.checkOverlap(bubble, x, y, radius + 15)));

}}}
```


<h3>Future Implementation</h3>

1. **Zoom in and Zoom out**

    The screen will track the user's point of view, enabling zoom in and zoom out functionalities to provide users with a broader perspective of the entire game environment.

2. **Infinite Canvas with Pan**

    Implementing an infinite canvas will allow users to explore a vast world beyond the game's boundaries and facilitate seamless, continuous exploration within the game environment.
