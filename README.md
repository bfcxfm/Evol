In this game, you will take control of the black bubble as the player and navigate it through a playground filled with bubbles of various sizes. Your mission is to become the largest bubble in the playground by consuming smaller bubbles and growing in size.

Be cautious though! If your bubble accidentally touches a bubble larger than itself, your size will start to shrink. To emerge victorious, swiftly maneuver away from larger bubbles to avoid diminishing in size. Remember, the player will only triumph if they remain larger than any other bubble in the playground.
